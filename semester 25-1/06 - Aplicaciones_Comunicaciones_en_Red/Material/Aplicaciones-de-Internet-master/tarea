Git (/ɡɪt/)[7] is a distributed version-control
system for tracking changes in source code during software development.[8] It is designed for coordinating work among programmers,
but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.
Its goals include speed,[9] data integrity,[10] and support for
distributed, non-linear workflows.[11]

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the
Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial
development.[12] Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano.
As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most
client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a
full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking
abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[13]

History

Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control management (SCM) system that they had formerly used to maintain the project.[14] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had created SourcePuller by reverse engineering the BitKeeper protocols.[15] The same incident also spurred the creation of another version-control system, Mercurial.

Linus Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs. Torvalds cited an example of a source-control management system needing 30 seconds to apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale to the needs of Linux kernel development, where synchronizing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at once. For his design criteria, he specified that patching should take no more than three seconds,[9] and added three more points:

Naming

Torvalds sarcastically quipped about the name git (which means unpleasant person in British English slang): "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."[23][24] The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".[25] The read-me file of the source code elaborates further:[26]
